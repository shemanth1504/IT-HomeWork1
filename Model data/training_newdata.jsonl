{"text":"Yes, it does depend on the type of rice. For a white rice, I usually use Jasmine. The pot I use to cook rice in has a glass lid so I can check it without removing the lid. For 3 cups of cooked rice, rinse 1 cup of uncooked rice and let drain while you bring 2 cups of water to a boil. You could add 1 tsp. chicken, beef or vegetable bouillon base for flavoring if you want. Once the water comes to a boil, stir in the rice, cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook 15 - 20 minutes until all of the water has evaporated. If your pot has a glass lid, you can just tilt the pot to see if any water remains.

You could add 1 tsp. chicken, beef or vegetable bouillon base for flavoring if you want. Once the water comes to a boil, stir in the rice, cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook 15 - 20 minutes until all of the water has evaporated.

I've made it half a dozen times and it always turns out great. I add mushrooms and black olives as toppings. You'll see a comment chain from me on the pizza yeast, I can tell you it's not necessary. As OP said, fast-acting yeast of any kind works. What *is* necessary (to me, anyway) is brushing the top of the exposed crust on the sides liberally with butter or olive oil.

{"text":"Durability and weight mainly, a plastic board is much more susceptible to being knocked around simply due to being vastly lighter for one. Though that same lightness may be an actual benefit depending on how you see yourself using it. As for the durability a high quality wood cutting board if well maintained will last a *very* long time through a significant amount of abuse. Meanwhile plastic can only take so much before it needs to be replaced. Additionally wood has the benefit of looking significantly better (in my personal opinion anyway) and having the possible advantage of being turned into an entire counter/island for an absolutely massive work surface if you wanted to go that route. The main durability concerns are mostly going to be gouging into the board, especially if you are using something like a cleaver and swinging with force through bones you will quickly destroy a normal plastic board. Assuming you aren't going to be doing that it will still inevitability accumulate many little scratches that would be recovered in a wooden board during maintenance. If you intend on running it through the dishwasher its lifespan will dramatically decrease due to the likelihood of warping but I don't count that against it really since it isn't like you can through wooden boards through a dishwasher anyway. At the end of the day despite being a crazy elitist personally who loves his high quality wooden cutting board I'm pretty sure what you are looking for is a plastic one. Just make sure to get the biggest size the other person has room to put it since it really is a massive pain to work on a tiny little board. Plastic trades top end quality and lifespan for ease of maintenance and weight/thickness as well as being significantly cheaper and that sounds like where your priorities are at. Though for real make sure to tell them not to try and put it in the dishwasher, depending on the washer it really can ruin them really fast, plastic easily warps when heated and things get surprisingly hot in a modern dishwasher.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

Though that same lightness may be an actual benefit depending on how you see yourself using it. As for the durability a high quality wood cutting board if well maintained will last a *very* long time through a significant amount of abuse. Meanwhile plastic can only take so much before it needs to be replaced. Additionally wood has the benefit of looking significantly better (in my personal opinion anyway) and having the possible advantage of being turned into an entire counter/island for an absolutely massive work surface if you wanted to go that route. The main durability concerns are mostly going to be gouging into the board, especially if you are using something like a cleaver and swinging with force through bones you will quickly destroy a normal plastic board. Assuming you aren't going to be doing that it will still inevitability accumulate many little scratches that would be recovered in a wooden board during maintenance. If you intend on running it through the dishwasher its lifespan will dramatically decrease due to the likelihood of warping but I don't count that against it really since it isn't like you can through wooden boards through a dishwasher anyway. At the end of the day despite being a crazy elitist personally who loves his high quality wooden cutting board I'm pretty sure what you are looking for is a plastic one. Just make sure to get the biggest size the other person has room to put it since it really is a massive pain to work on a tiny little board. Plastic trades top end quality and lifespan for ease of maintenance and weight/thickness as well as being significantly cheaper and that sounds like where your priorities are at. Though for real make sure to tell them not to try and put it in the dishwasher, depending on the washer it really can ruin them really fast, plastic easily warps when heated and things get surprisingly hot in a modern dishwasher.\n'''","response":"DISH: \nEQUIPMENT: plastic board, wood cutting board, cleaver, dishwasher\nINGREDIENT:"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1698846823,"_annotator_id":"ff47c701-d67c-4c58-bd2e-210f92bba469","_session_id":"88fc32b7-a18f-4ded-909b-e0e513303522"}

{"text":"Well that's kind of the point of those oils, they should be \"forgettable \" insofar that they don't impart any flavors to the dish. Hence the term neutral oil! Honestly for sauteeing, canola oil is just fine, I wrote it off because it just gets weird when you use it for deep frying, the flavor is off. So I just dont buy it, and grapeseed replaced it. But I agree, olive oil has a tremendous flavor, and it doesn't go with all cuisine types, either. If I'm sauteeing anything for Mexican, Indian, Chinese or other asian food, I'm not using olive oil. I made stovetop popcorn tonight, I don't make it as often as you, but I used my spanish evoo because I prefer it. My uncle used to make stovetop popcorn when I was young and he used some kind of olive oil. We have coconut oil but I never cook with it, I have never been into what i perceive to be a fad, but I am curious as to what you think makes it better?

So I just dont buy it, and grapeseed replaced it. But I agree, olive oil has a tremendous flavor, and it doesn't go with all cuisine types, either. If I'm sauteeing anything for Mexican, Indian, Chinese or other asian food, I'm not using olive oil. I made stovetop popcorn tonight, I don't make it as often as you, but I used my spanish evoo because I prefer it. My uncle used to make stovetop popcorn when I was young and he used some kind of olive oil. We have coconut oil but I never cook with it, I have never been into what i perceive to be a fad, but I am curious as to what you think makes it better?

{"text":"Everyone has their own recipe for sauce. My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through. I usually add the baking soda about 1/2 way through the process.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through.

I would also recommend an offset cake spatula and if you have the money, a rotating cake stand. Fondant doesn't require much in the way of tools, its essentially a sugar dough but with gelatin instead of gluten. So perhaps a decent rolling pin( go to home depot and get a bit of dowel) and a couple of stencils. Also, and this might sound weird, decent saran wrap. Im not talking shit you buy at safeway.

{"text":"Oh, you make it with that magical top cheese crust? Just like Mom! Wonderful. So the dilemma is whether they get that first-night cheese-crust experience or not; whether they want to sit there while it bakes for the first time. Some thoughts: 1) Reheating already-baked lasagna loses the crispness of the crust, but of course the bulk of the lasagna itself only improves after cooking . . . over days, if you ask me. 2) Though, depending on how they'll re-heat; if they use the oven then it might not take *that* much longer to bake it, I dunno? But if they just 'wave it then it's much quicker. 3) If you've already followed that first advice, great!

{"text":"Sounds like your problem was you were keeping the butter in one of the most variable temp zones of your kitchen. Maybe instead of spending time and money on things like a butter bell, you just don't keep it by the stove in the future? Heck, why not test it in comparison since you *have* the bell now. Try an amount of butter in the bell and the same amount in the traditional butter dish (*not* kept by the stove) and compare their freshness and tendency to mold over time. If there's little to no difference, there's no point in the bell.

{"text":"If you want fairly easy cooking (and you have the available counter space), as well as cooking that translates well into leftovers/packed lunches, I would look into getting a slow cooker. Other than that the bare essentials are a skillet, pot, cutting board, and an oven pan (the stove does come with oven attached yes?). As well as the usual utensils (knives, measuring cups, etc). Those items should get you through most recipes fairly easily. A rice cooker is usually a good buy too since it can do a lot more than just rice. At least as long as the model isn't absolutely ancient. For example most rice cookers come with a steamer basket that you can use to steam a variety of things very easily (veggies, shrimp, pork bao, etc). You can also hard boil eggs as you cook rice (just place the eggs on top of the rice and press cook rice! Perfect hard boiled eggs every time) or steam them (without rice) for soft boiled eggs.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

Those items should get you through most recipes fairly easily. A rice cooker is usually a good buy too since it can do a lot more than just rice. At least as long as the model isn't absolutely ancient. For example most rice cookers come with a steamer basket that you can use to steam a variety of things very easily (veggies, shrimp, pork bao, etc). You can also hard boil eggs as you cook rice (just place the eggs on top of the rice and press cook rice! Perfect hard boiled eggs every time) or steam them (without rice) for soft boiled eggs.\n'''","response":"EQUIPMENT: slow cooker, skillet, pot, cutting board, oven pan, utensils, knives, measuring cups, rice cooker, steamer basket\nDISH: rice, pork bao\nINGREDIENT: veggies, shrimp"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1698846685,"_annotator_id":"6fb6980c-7044-4060-a216-d05282560d01","_session_id":"38ef8aa6-0a0c-438f-b5c8-44adca5979bb"}

{"text":"My method is to start by frying ginger, garlic, and onions. Since you're doing meat you could do that before or after those basic spices. Cook the meat until it is nearly ready, then about 5 minutes before you are done, throw in your sauces and your vegetables. Cover the pan if possible. They only need to steam for a couple minutes usually, longer if not covered. If you have rice noodles that steam instantly you can throw those in for the last 1 minute (again covered) and then you're done. Toss some sesame seeds on and eat up!

{"text":"You should get into quick pickles if you haven't already - so good... easy/fast to make too. Recipe I use is two cups white vinegar, two cups water (hot water helps sugar dissolve), half cup sugar. Mix together and that's your pickling liquid. Chop up hot peppers, red onion, carrots, daikon, whatever veggies you like and put them in a jar with a tight lid. Pack them in there good and then pour in pickling liquid until jar is full. Screw lid on tightly and pop the jar in the fridge for a while (overnight at least). You can add pickles to pretty much any dish (pickled red onions are killer on pork tacos, for example) and they're even good as a stand alone snack - serious punch of flavor (sweet/tangy) and heat (if

{"text":"Hopefully I don't invite controversy with this... (because my experience is not based on Russia-specific heritage). I, myself, have no Russian heritage. But my experience with *similar* foods comes from my Ukrainian step-grandmother (who is sadly, no longer capable of making her amazing dishes). I absolutely loved her borshch and golumpki. She made perogi** often too, but I could take those or leave them. I wish I had her specific recipe for the former two, as I'd happily make them often. I've never found ones that taste and look exactly like I remember. **Note: Wikipedia tells me the ukranian term for this is vareniki, but I still use the terms she used and I was raised on. I don't know why she called certain things what she did, only that they are ingrained as fond memories by those terms. I have never tried bliny, kvas, or shashlyk.

{"text":"In school, I learned 3 basic types of battering. IRL(work), I apply them regularly, with varying functionality. First, the standard breeding procedure, or wet-dry-wet method. Alton Brown featured this method frequently, and stressed the all important \"wet hand\" and \"dry hand.\" This is traditionally Flour, egg wash (egg, milk), and your finishing coat (bread crumbs, flour, or cornmeal). This method will create a nice crunchy batter when fried. It is good for cheese, meats, poultry, vegetables. Second, the wet batter. This contains the famous Tempura style batter and Beer batter. Basically, mix flour with your wet ingredient. Dip what you want fried in the batter, and fry it. Usually, you will coat what your food in a starch of some kind before applying batter, but you do not always have to. Usually you see vegetables fried like this. Meat options I have seen are beer battered Cod and corn dogs Third is dusting or coating in the dry batter. This is used on seafood a lot. Fried oysters, calamari, shrimp. Also, anything \"lightly breaded\" is usually prepared this way. Basically, toss or coat your food in seasoned or plain flour, cornmeal, bread crumbs, etc. and cook. Often, the fried item in question will either be wet from its own juice already (like shucked oysters in a tub are) or will be in a bath or sorts (like soaking catfish filets in seasoned buttermilk).

IRL(work), I apply them regularly, with varying functionality. First, the standard breeding procedure, or wet-dry-wet method. Alton Brown featured this method frequently, and stressed the all important \"wet hand\" and \"dry hand.\" This is traditionally Flour, egg wash (egg, milk), and your finishing coat (bread crumbs, flour, or cornmeal). This method will create a nice crunchy batter when fried. It is good for cheese, meats, poultry, vegetables. Second, the wet batter. This contains the famous Tempura style batter and Beer batter. Basically, mix flour with your wet ingredient. Dip what you want fried in the batter, and fry it. Usually, you will coat what your food in a starch of some kind before applying batter, but you do not always have to. Usually you see vegetables fried like this. Meat options I have seen are beer battered Cod and corn dogs Third is dusting or coating in the dry batter. This is used on seafood a lot. Fried oysters, calamari, shrimp. Also, anything \"lightly breaded\" is usually prepared this way. Basically, toss or coat your food in seasoned or plain flour, cornmeal, bread crumbs, etc. and cook. Often, the fried item in question will either be wet from its own juice already (like shucked oysters in a tub are) or will be in a bath or sorts (like soaking catfish filets in seasoned buttermilk).

{"text":"This is 100% a guess, but I could imagine that with the bones clad in meat, there will be less opportunity for collagen to convert to gelatin and leech into the fluid, so you might end up with less of the \"Lip Smacking\" qualities. But, you'd gain flavour from the meat, so there's that. You *could* add gelatin leaves or powder to your broth and maybe get the best of both worlds? &amp;#x200B; There would be more fat with a whole carcass, so you'd have to remove more. &amp;#x200B; I imagine some people would claim that the meat will be overcooked and dilute in flavour by the time a broth has extracted it, so it's a waste of meat. If you like the texture and flavour of the result, go nuts. &amp;#x200B; BTW, I checked The Food Lab by Kenji Lopez-Alt, and he believes that the difference between Broth and Stock is only relevant to a restaurant chef.

{"text":"A largish pot with a steamer that fits on top and a glass lid. You need a large pot for boiling pasta, and you'll find the steamer will mean you eat more vegetables because they are easy to steam over your pasta or potatoes. The glass lid means you can see how the veg is going without lifting the lid. A heavyish bottom on the pot would be nice too. As large and heavy a stainless steel frypan as you can comfortably handle, with glass lid. You can make an obscene quantity of bolognaise sauce or chili at once with this thing. Lid means you can put the whole shebang in the fridge without dirtying anything else. Glass lid means you won't forget what is in it while it is in the fridge. Two or three acceptable quality stainless steel saucepans with lids and heavy bottoms. There's nothing wrong with sets so long as the quality is acceptable and price is right. A smallish non stick frypan suitable for a one or two egg omelet.

As large and heavy a stainless steel frypan as you can comfortably handle, with glass lid. You can make an obscene quantity of bolognaise sauce or chili at once with this thing. Lid means you can put the whole shebang in the fridge without dirtying anything else. Glass lid means you won't forget what is in it while it is in the fridge. Two or three acceptable quality stainless steel saucepans with lids and heavy bottoms. There's nothing wrong with sets so long as the quality is acceptable and price is right.

{"text":"My one tip is that if you do any meat butchering, make sure you have a good knife. Don't be like my mother and try to butcher things with a serrated paring knife or something like that. You want a chef's knife or a butcher's cleaver, depending on how big the thing you are cutting is. You want it sharp and somewhat heavy. I know this sounds weird, but sharper knifes are safer because you need to use less force on the knife to get it to cut. Putting a lot of force behind a knife is how fingers get lost.

You want a chef's knife or a butcher's cleaver, depending on how big the thing you are cutting is. You want it sharp and somewhat heavy. I know this sounds weird, but sharper knifes are safer because you need to use less force on the knife to get it to cut. Putting a lot of force behind a knife is how fingers get lost. You also want the knife to have a little heft because when butchering meat you do have to cut the occasional joint or small bone. Again, not a job for a pairing knife.

{"text":"You know, every time I order out they never give me enough sauce so I end up making my own and I never regret it Mayo is a great base, and it's easy as fuck to make: 1Egg yolk' a little dollop of Dijon mustard, a squeeze of lemon juice in a mixer or blender. Turn it on and drizzle about a cup of olive oil in. Homemade mayo is always better. If I order sushi I mix that with wasabi, wasabi mayo is proof God exists. sriacha for deliciousness with fried stuff The juice from chipotle for Mexican flare Relish for tartar Buttermilk for a ranch dip Anchovy and mustard for Caesar dressing Another great base is basic yogurt Mix with garlic and cucumber for tzasiki Lemon and Herbs for just herb dip Capers and onions goes good on fish Horseradish too Ketchup and horse radish is cocktail sauce Mayo and ketchup is thousand island Mustard and mayo is just a good dip Then there's the mother sauces, most of them start with a roux: A roux is made by heating equal parts fat and flour. You leave it until the flour has been cooked. It should smell like toasted bread and take on a blonde appearance. Some recipes call for darker roux A bechamel is what happens when you add milk to your roux A veloute is what happens when you add a add a white stock like fish or chicken to your roux An espagnol is what happens when you add brown stock like beef or duck to your roux (it's also called gravy) A tomate is what happens when you add tomato pur\u00e9e to your roux Then there's emulsifications, mayo falls into this category. When something has been emulsified it means they are mixed until they cannot separate. You usually need an emulsifier, this keeps everything neat and tidy. A common emulsifier is egg yolk Hollandaise is what happens when you emulsify melted butter with air. Think of it as mayo. But instead of oil you're using butter. Put a stick of butter in a double boiler, add an egg yolk and get to whipping. It's amazing. You can easily make mustard by grinding seeds up in a coffee grinder, adding red wine vinegar and salt and letting it sit Ketchup is strained tomato sauce, sugar, and red wine vinegar Hot sauce fermented chili peppers. Add fresh hot peppers to a jar that's CLEAN, cover with salt. Cover and leave in a warm dark area, shaking it every other day, opening it to burp it every now and then. Pur\u00e9e and strain. You can make a basic Mexican sauce with dried peppers, I use ancho and guajillo. Toast and de seed them, make a bed of sliced white onions in a large skillet, add your peppers to the top of it, fill with about a half inch of beef stock, oregano and salt, cover and simmer for 30 mins. Pur\u00e9e and strain. Add tamarind paste and dark chocolate and cumin and cinnamon for a basic mole Grill tomatillos, peel, pur\u00e9e with onions, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, lime juice and garlic for a salsa verde. Grill Anaheim or hatch chiles, peel and chop with garlic for a New Mexico style green chili Add fish sauce to any of the above chili sauces for a Thai inspired chili sauce Equal parts fish sauce and brown sugar, water for a Vietnamese dipping sauce Fish sauce, peanut butter and soy sauce for a peanut sauce Fish sauce, brown sugar water and onions will reduce and make a great glaze for grilled chicken Equal parts soy sauce and rice vinegar with a touch of sesame oil for a Korean style dipping sauce Soy sauce and brown sugar makes teriyaki sauce Black bean hummus and fish sauce makes a

Turn it on and drizzle about a cup of olive oil in. Homemade mayo is always better. If I order sushi I mix that with wasabi, wasabi mayo is proof God exists. sriacha for deliciousness with fried stuff The juice from chipotle for Mexican flare Relish for tartar Buttermilk for a ranch dip Anchovy and mustard for Caesar dressing Another great base is basic yogurt Mix with garlic and cucumber for tzasiki Lemon and Herbs for just herb dip Capers and onions goes good on fish Horseradish too Ketchup and horse radish is cocktail sauce Mayo and ketchup is thousand island Mustard and mayo is just a good dip Then there's the mother sauces, most of them start with a roux: A roux is made by heating equal parts fat and flour. You leave it until the flour has been cooked. It should smell like toasted bread and take on a blonde appearance. Some recipes call for darker roux A bechamel is what happens when you add milk to your roux A veloute is what happens when you add a add a white stock like fish or chicken to your roux An espagnol is what happens when you add brown stock like beef or duck to your roux (it's also called gravy) A tomate is what happens when you add tomato pur\u00e9e to your roux Then there's emulsifications, mayo falls into this category. When something has been emulsified it means they are mixed until they cannot separate. You usually need an emulsifier, this keeps everything neat and tidy. A common emulsifier is egg yolk Hollandaise is what happens when you emulsify melted butter with air. Think of it as mayo. But instead of oil you're using butter. Put a stick of butter in a double boiler, add an egg yolk and get to whipping. It's amazing. You can easily make mustard by grinding seeds up in a coffee grinder, adding red wine vinegar and salt and letting it sit Ketchup is strained tomato sauce, sugar, and red wine vinegar Hot sauce fermented chili peppers. Add fresh hot peppers to a jar that's CLEAN, cover with salt. Cover and leave in a warm dark area, shaking it every other day, opening it to burp it every now and then. Pur\u00e9e and strain. You can make a basic Mexican sauce with dried peppers, I use ancho and guajillo. Toast and de seed them, make a bed of sliced white onions in a large skillet, add your peppers to the top of it, fill with about a half inch of beef stock, oregano and salt, cover and simmer for 30 mins. Pur\u00e9e and strain. Add tamarind paste and dark chocolate and cumin and cinnamon for a basic mole Grill tomatillos, peel, pur\u00e9e with onions, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, lime juice and garlic for a salsa verde. Grill Anaheim or hatch chiles, peel and chop with garlic for a New Mexico style green chili Add fish sauce to any of the above chili sauces for a Thai inspired chili sauce Equal parts fish sauce and brown sugar, water for a Vietnamese dipping sauce Fish sauce, peanut butter and soy sauce for a peanut sauce Fish sauce, brown sugar water and onions will reduce and make a great glaze for grilled chicken Equal parts soy sauce and rice vinegar with a touch of sesame oil for a Korean style dipping sauce Soy sauce and brown sugar makes teriyaki sauce Black bean hummus and fish sauce makes a really remarkable Korean inspired sauce for tofu Soy sauce mixed with tahini for a super great sesame glaze for chicken Soy sauce and lime juice is a great dipping sauce for fish or dumplings Rice vinegar and cucumber makes a great refreshing sauce for rice\n'''","response":"DISH: mayo, wasabi mayo, sriacha, tartar, ranch dip, Caesar dressing, herb dip, cocktail sauce, thousand island, good dip, mother sauces, roux, bechamel, veloute, espagnol, tomate, emulsifications, Hollandaise, mustard, ketchup, hot sauce, basic Mexican sauce, mole, salsa verde, New Mexico style green chili, Thai inspired chili sauce, Vietnamese dipping sauce, peanut sauce, glaze for grilled chicken, Korean style dipping sauce, teriyaki sauce, Korean inspired sauce for tofu, sesame glaze for chicken, dipping sauce for fish or dumplings, refreshing sauce for rice\nINGREDIENT: egg yolk, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, cucumber, lemon, herbs, capers, onions, horseradish, ketchup, horse radish, mustard, flour, milk, white stock, brown stock, tomato pur\u00e9e, melted butter, air, red wine vinegar, salt, chili peppers, dried peppers, ancho, guajillo, beef stock, oregano, tamarind paste, dark chocolate, cumin, cinnamon, tomatillos, onions, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, lime juice, garlic, Anaheim or hatch chiles, fish sauce, brown sugar, water, peanut butter, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, black bean hummus, tahini, lime juice, cucumber\nEQUIPMENT: mixer, blender, oven, cooking pot, grill, coffee grinder, double boiler, jar, skillet"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1698846964,"_annotator_id":"8232bc70-2e57-46a0-88c2-e0d09a42475d","_session_id":"4af1c995-95ae-42e0-9869-3c581094eb1f"}

{"text":"The food bible is an awesome reference book if you're not super confident as it's basically an encyclopedia in which you look up one ingredient and it lists which spices, sides, etc. to pair. There are also recipes in it as well! I will also suggest that you stick with some classic pairings (usually French is most familiar to Americans). For example: beef is traditionally served with a simple pan sauce or a horseradish cream sauce. Salmon and dill are a no brainer! ( try taking those traditional pairings and seasonings and using them in creative ways, like horseradish cream mashed potatoes with steak, or dill and bacon creamed corn with salmon) Pairing a meat with something that it often eats is also a great strategy.

{"text":"Don't let everyone talk you out of starting from a fresh ham! If you wanna try something different without the difficulty of curing your own, then just brine one. My mom did this for Easter last year and it was delicious, and not at all difficult. It'll be different than what you get in stores, but still awesome - like a cross between regular ham and pork tenderloin. I don't have a guide, but I can tell you what she did (sort of). Start with a fresh ham, obviously. You should be able to get one from a local farm/farmer's market, or a decent butcher. If you want a prettier pattern and crispier skin, score it in a crosshatch pattern. Brine it in a salt/sugar/water mixture for about 24-36 hours. (If you want to turn this into more traditional curing, you can add nitrates and leave the ham in for much longer.) You can also include spices in the brine, depending on the flavor profile you're going for. When it's finished brining, bake it in a pan filled with water (keeps it moister) and prepare a glaze. The glaze is probably where you'd wanna work the Bud Light in. A traditional glaze has is usually sweet and spiced, with brown sugar, mustard, cloves, etc...I imagine you could work beer into that. Sorry for the vague directions but if you google \"brining a fresh ham\" you should get plenty of instructions and flavoring ideas!","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

If you wanna try something different without the difficulty of curing your own, then just brine one. My mom did this for Easter last year and it was delicious, and not at all difficult. It'll be different than what you get in stores, but still awesome - like a cross between regular ham and pork tenderloin. I don't have a guide, but I can tell you what she did (sort of). Start with a fresh ham, obviously. You should be able to get one from a local farm/farmer's market, or a decent butcher. If you want a prettier pattern and crispier skin, score it in a crosshatch pattern. Brine it in a salt/sugar/water mixture for about 24-36 hours. (If you want to turn this into more traditional curing, you can add nitrates and leave the ham in for much longer.) You can also include spices in the brine, depending on the flavor profile you're going for. When it's finished brining, bake it in a pan filled with water (keeps it moister) and prepare a glaze. The glaze is probably where you'd wanna work the Bud Light in. A traditional glaze has is usually sweet and spiced, with brown sugar, mustard, cloves, etc...I imagine you could work beer into that.

Indirect heat, minion method with apple wood chunks, fat cap down, no injection or mop.

{"text":"I don't know your cooking skills or your traditional ingredients, so I hope this helps. You mentioned you don't want to hunt down 18+ ingredients and I understand that - needing to find a ton of specialty ingredients for one dish can be exhausting, time consuming, and expensive. However, I would suggest expanding your basic spices and additives. Pepper, salt, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, cinnamon, onion and garlic powder, basil, marjoram, lemon and lime juice, soy sauce, chili oil, fish sauce, ginger... these are my basic staples in the kitchen. You can do tons of Latin, American, Spanish, French, Italian, and Chinese dishes with these (not all at once, obviously). And you don't need to get them all at once! Buying a new spice every couple of weeks to add to your cabinet allows you to cook with limited ingredients and understand what they bring to a dish, then adding a new one shows you how it impacts the flavor. If you're looking for gravy, learn how to make a roux (often melted butter mixed with flour, sometimes oil instead of butter. Depending on the recipe, you add spices after it's thick, sometimes after you've added meat/veggies/stock). This is highly customizable - you can start gumbo, some chilis, mushroom gravy for Jaegerschnitzel, alfredo, etc. If you're looking to start learning curries, most grocery stores have premade curries (both Indian and Thai). They will also often have paste which is meant to be fried and/or have liquid (can be stock, cream, or Coconut milk. Read the label and do research!) added to it while cooking. Once you start understanding the flavors, find a local Asian market/spice shop and pick up garam masala, chilis specific to regions of the world, etc. Also, you can typically find tons of spices for very cheap in much more bulk in Asian and Latin markets than a regular grocery store. I personally do meal prep with chicken because I like to find them on sale and have an easy dinner sitting in my freezer/fridge. Marinades are awesome. Lemon-Garlic: 2 tbsp lemon juice, minced garlic, 1-2 tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. Mustard: 1-2 tbsp olive oil, at least 2 tbsp dijon, splash of lemon, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder, chili powder or cayenne for more spice. Honey-Dijon 1 tbsp honey, 2 tbsp dijon, minced garlic, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder. Savory-Spicy: 1 tbsp Worchestire, 1tspish Fish Sauce, salt, pepper, cayenne, chili oil to taste (read, not a lot unless you are into super spicy), chili powder, paprika. I bake these and halfway through, top with more liquid. For example, the lemon one needs a bit of lemon juice and olive oil, the mustard one should have dijon put on, the honey one should have a little of both dijon and honey, the savory one should get some Worchestire and chili oil. It helps keep them moist! Also, as you put them in a container/bag to marinate, make sure to stab the chicken first with a fork to let all the ingredients seep in. I also suggest looking into some thicker dishes like Shakshuka. It's a Middle Eastern dish that focuses on a thick tomato sauce with eggs. It can be made sweeter for breakfast or spicy for lunch/dinner. I know you mentioned you don't prefer sweet, but do make sure to put in some sugar or it will taste off. Otherwise, it's tomatoes, bell peppers, hot peppers and a variety of spices. One pot for everything, pop in some eggs and cook them to whatever firmness you prefer! It's traditionally served with crusty bread, but I've seen it with pita and crackers. The last thing I'll suggest is roasted red bell pepper pasta. I have access to extremely cheap and tasty roasted bell peppers in a jar (I prefer them being softer), but you could easily roast them yourself if you have access to cheap peppers and a bit of time. Melt some butter, saute some onions until soft, add in minced garlic when the onions are a minute away, add in sliced roasted bell peppers, let it all meet for a bit. Blend it in whatever you have, put it back. At this point, you can add 1 cup of water, stock, or cream depending on what you want. Salt, pepper, dried chili flakes, a little chili powder, garlic and onion powder. Let it reduce for 5-10 minutes depending on what liquid you added. Throw in cooked pasta and it looks super fancy for super cheap and easy. And you can make it as spicy as you want! More chili flakes, chili oil, cayenne, jalapenos or habaneros (during the cooking process) all lend themselves well to this dish. Good luck and enjoy! Sorry for the wall of text. I just love suggesting ideas for newer cooks like myself.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

You mentioned you don't want to hunt down 18+ ingredients and I understand that - needing to find a ton of specialty ingredients for one dish can be exhausting, time consuming, and expensive. However, I would suggest expanding your basic spices and additives. Pepper, salt, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, cinnamon, onion and garlic powder, basil, marjoram, lemon and lime juice, soy sauce, chili oil, fish sauce, ginger... these are my basic staples in the kitchen. You can do tons of Latin, American, Spanish, French, Italian, and Chinese dishes with these (not all at once, obviously). And you don't need to get them all at once! Buying a new spice every couple of weeks to add to your cabinet allows you to cook with limited ingredients and understand what they bring to a dish, then adding a new one shows you how it impacts the flavor. If you're looking for gravy, learn how to make a roux (often melted butter mixed with flour, sometimes oil instead of butter. Depending on the recipe, you add spices after it's thick, sometimes after you've added meat/veggies/stock). This is highly customizable - you can start gumbo, some chilis, mushroom gravy for Jaegerschnitzel, alfredo, etc. If you're looking to start learning curries, most grocery stores have premade curries (both Indian and Thai). They will also often have paste which is meant to be fried and/or have liquid (can be stock, cream, or Coconut milk. Read the label and do research!) added to it while cooking. Once you start understanding the flavors, find a local Asian market/spice shop and pick up garam masala, chilis specific to regions of the world, etc. Also, you can typically find tons of spices for very cheap in much more bulk in Asian and Latin markets than a regular grocery store. I personally do meal prep with chicken because I like to find them on sale and have an easy dinner sitting in my freezer/fridge. Marinades are awesome. Lemon-Garlic: 2 tbsp lemon juice, minced garlic, 1-2 tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. Mustard: 1-2 tbsp olive oil, at least 2 tbsp dijon, splash of lemon, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder, chili powder or cayenne for more spice. Honey-Dijon 1 tbsp honey, 2 tbsp dijon, minced garlic, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder. Savory-Spicy: 1 tbsp Worchestire, 1tspish Fish Sauce, salt, pepper, cayenne, chili oil to taste (read, not a lot unless you are into super spicy), chili powder, paprika. I bake these and halfway through, top with more liquid. For example, the lemon one needs a bit of lemon juice and olive oil, the mustard one should have dijon put on, the honey one should have a little of both dijon and honey, the savory one should get some Worchestire and chili oil. It helps keep them moist! Also, as you put them in a container/bag to marinate, make sure to stab the chicken first with a fork to let all the ingredients seep in. I also suggest looking into some thicker dishes like Shakshuka. It's a Middle Eastern dish that focuses on a thick tomato sauce with eggs. It can be made sweeter for breakfast or spicy for lunch/dinner. I know you mentioned you don't prefer sweet, but do make sure to put in some sugar or it will taste off. Otherwise, it's tomatoes, bell peppers, hot peppers and a variety of spices. One pot for everything, pop in some eggs and cook them to whatever firmness you prefer! It's traditionally served with crusty bread, but I've seen it with pita and crackers. The last thing I'll suggest is roasted red bell pepper pasta. I have access to extremely cheap and tasty roasted bell peppers in a jar (I prefer them being softer), but you could easily roast them yourself if you have access to cheap peppers and a bit of time. Melt some butter, saute some onions until soft, add in minced garlic when the onions are a minute away, add in sliced roasted bell peppers, let it all meet for a bit. Blend it in whatever you have, put it back. At this point, you can add 1 cup of water, stock, or cream depending on what you want. Salt, pepper, dried chili flakes, a little chili powder, garlic and onion powder. Let it reduce for 5-10 minutes depending on what liquid you added. Throw in cooked pasta and it looks super fancy for super cheap and easy. And you can make it as spicy as you want! More chili flakes, chili oil, cayenne, jalapenos or habaneros (during the cooking process) all lend themselves well to this dish. Good luck and enjoy! Sorry for the wall of text. I just love suggesting ideas for newer cooks like myself.\n'''","response":"DISH: gumbo, chilis, mushroom gravy, Jaegerschnitzel, alfredo, curries, Shakshuka, roasted red bell pepper pasta\nINGREDIENT: pepper, salt, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, cinnamon, onion powder, garlic powder, basil, marjoram, lemon juice, lime juice, soy sauce, chili oil, fish sauce, ginger, roux, garam masala, dijon, honey, Worchestire, lemon, olive oil, sugar, tomatoes, bell peppers, hot peppers, eggs, crusty bread, pita, crackers, red bell peppers, butter, onions, minced garlic, dried chili flakes, jalapenos, habaneros\nEQUIPMENT: oven, cooking pot"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1698847011,"_annotator_id":"668585f3-4c4e-4a5f-8525-76de3f52017b","_session_id":"3081c4a8-296a-4fa3-8151-90dcb9c59fea"}

{"text":"I'm not sure I'll ever forget the time I literally changed my work buddy's life with alfredo sauce. I'd come over after lunch to finish helping him set up and wire his living room for football on sundays with The Ticket (in a nutshell, all 4 roommates would bring their individual TV'S and boxes in, so we had up to 5 games on at a time). We ran into dinner time, he invited me to stay, saying he was gonna whip up some chicken alfredo. He pulled out a jar, and I said, \"Oh hell no. Your life is gonna change today,\" and I showed him how to make alfredo sauce while the pasta water boiled. Just a roux, milk, and parm with some pepper. He took one bite, got up, and chunked the jar of alfredo in the trash. I later taught him 3 ingredient marinara and simple pan sauces. We lost touch beyond Facebook within a year, but he still invited me to his wedding despite not hearing each other's voice for 3 years.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

Side was chopped endive &amp; cubed avocado salad with a basalmic mustard vinaigrette (basalmic, grey poupon, and olive oil to taste) and a generous pinch of salt on top Dessert was a cheesecake that I baked and added cocoa powder and crushed up Take 5's (candy bar cheesecake) since the wife likes those things so much - it's her kryptonite. It was garnished with leftover graham crackers from the crust &amp; chocolate syrup.

{"text":"Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* ***Trimethylamine*** : --- > >**Trimethylamine** is an organic compound with the formula N(CH3)3. This colorless, hygroscopic, and flammable tertiary amine has a strong \"fishy\" odor in low concentrations and an ammonia-like odor at higher concentrations. It is a gas at room temperature but is usually sold in pressurized gas cylinders or as a 40% solution in water. >Trimethylamine is a product of decomposition of plants and animals. It is the substance mainly responsible for the odor often associated with rotting fish, some infections, bad breath and can be a cause of vaginal odor due to bacterial vaginosis. It is also associated with taking large doses of choline and carnitine. >Trimethylamine is a nitrogenous base and can be readily protonated to give trimethylammonium cation. Trimethylammonium chloride is a hygroscopic colorless solid prepared from hydrochloric acid. Trimethylamine is a good nucleophile, and this reaction is the basis of most of its applications. --- ^(about) ^| *^(/u/UNHDude can reply with 'delete'.

This colorless, hygroscopic, and flammable tertiary amine has a strong \"fishy\" odor in low concentrations and an ammonia-like odor at higher concentrations. It is a gas at room temperature but is usually sold in pressurized gas cylinders or as a 40% solution in water. >Trimethylamine is a product of decomposition of plants and animals. It is the substance mainly responsible for the odor often associated with rotting fish, some infections, bad breath and can be a cause of vaginal odor due to bacterial vaginosis. It is also associated with taking large doses of choline and carnitine. >Trimethylamine is a nitrogenous base and can be readily protonated to give trimethylammonium cation. Trimethylammonium chloride is a hygroscopic colorless solid prepared from hydrochloric acid. Trimethylamine is a good nucleophile, and this reaction is the basis of most of its applications. --- ^(about) ^| *^(/u/UNHDude can reply with 'delete'.

{"text":"No problem! Be sure you secure the ends of the raw bacons with some toothpicks. Once its setup you can remove them. Cook it low and slow and flip here and there so it cooks evenly. Once it's pretty much done you can even brush it with a little BBQ sauce and give it a couple more minutes for that to setup too. I made this one time with jalapeno slices tucked up under the bacon.

{"text":"Pulled pork is really big, also \"american-style\" burgers (basically burgers with pickles on them as far as I can tell), BBQ sauce, wings, fried stuff. I'm even seeing chili dogs, and fries being called fries (instead of chips). A related trend is Tex-Mex and Mexican food, mainly nachos, tacos, and quesadillas. This is most notable in trendy pubs rather than there being heaps of restaurants selling solely American food, although those exist also. And it's not like they didn't have BBQ sauce or burgers here before. I'm just saying that at trendy places they now often have these types of foods and they're often marketed as \"Authentic American\" rather than being Aussie or some kind of fusion cuisine. However I'd argue the food is really American food made to suit Australian tastes (which isn't better or worse, just different), rather than authentic American.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

This is most notable in trendy pubs rather than there being heaps of restaurants selling solely American food, although those exist also. And it's not like they didn't have BBQ sauce or burgers here before. I'm just saying that at trendy places they now often have these types of foods and they're often marketed as \"Authentic American\" rather than being Aussie or some kind of fusion cuisine. However I'd argue the food is really American food made to suit Australian tastes (which isn't better or worse, just different), rather than authentic American.\n'''","response":"DISH: pulled pork, american-style burgers, BBQ sauce, wings, chili dogs, fries, nachos, tacos, quesadillas\nEQUIPMENT: \nINGREDIENT:"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1698847075,"_annotator_id":"8232bc70-2e57-46a0-88c2-e0d09a42475d","_session_id":"4af1c995-95ae-42e0-9869-3c581094eb1f"}

{"text":"Maybe something with your kitchen, but this one works for me (and I make a SHIT ton of them because I love some eggs). Bring water to a b oil, lid on, salted. Use a big enough pot too, you want your eggs not touching and completely covered with water. They should have room to move around. When water is boiling, drop eggs in slowly (I use refrigerated eggs and still works), and stir them around so they don't just sit on the same side. Leave the lid off its all good, cook for 6 minutes and 15 seconds (according to Ivan Ramen). I don't look at the timer so 6\\~7 minutes eyeballed. When that's over, drop them into an ice bath. I just let them rest long enough to not burn my hands when I peel them, Also I find it helpful to peel em in the water.

When water is boiling, drop eggs in slowly (I use refrigerated eggs and still works), and stir them around so they don't just sit on the same side. Leave the lid off its all good, cook for 6 minutes and 15 seconds (according to Ivan Ramen). I don't look at the timer so 6\\~7 minutes eyeballed. When that's over, drop them into an ice bath.

{"text":"This is all true. It is not \"hard\" to cook with cheap SS, but it is more difficult I guess Of course you can produce amazing dishes with any pan, just maybe not as easily or consistantly The differance is mainly in conductivity, besides obvious advantages as ergonomics and the like. SS is a poor conductor, and being thin, only maximizes this. The result is a pan that does not heat evenly, and can not hold onto its heat well. This means uneven cooking(some things will burn while others will not even brown), extended cooking times from poor heat retention and of course the durability and susceptibility to warping/discoloration/chiping is a lot higher. High quality SS pans layers SS, Aluminum, Copper and Iron to take qualities of other metals and make a pan that gives you an incredible even heating surface that retains its heat well(or poor in some cases which can be a good thing).

It is not \"hard\" to cook with cheap SS, but it is more difficult I guess Of course you can produce amazing dishes with any pan, just maybe not as easily or consistantly The differance is mainly in conductivity, besides obvious advantages as ergonomics and the like. SS is a poor conductor, and being thin, only maximizes this. The result is a pan that does not heat evenly, and can not hold onto its heat well. This means uneven cooking(some things will burn while others will not even brown), extended cooking times from poor heat retention and of course the durability and susceptibility to warping/discoloration/chiping is a lot higher. High quality SS pans layers SS, Aluminum, Copper and Iron to take qualities of other metals and make a pan that gives you an incredible even heating surface that retains its heat well(or poor in some cases which can be a good thing). SS is mainly used as the external metal, as it looks amazing, easy to clean, doesn't tarnish well, and is non reactive.\n'''","response":"DISH: \nEQUIPMENT: SS pan\nINGREDIENT:"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","answer":"ignore","_timestamp":1698846856,"_annotator_id":"5d0d1094-b69c-4355-8cde-a6e4f12e95da","_session_id":"f0ec11df-db43-4b7c-a4ae-b7fe00c2c6ad"}

{"text":"Alright mate, here is the deal. I'm by no means a burger master, but I make a decent burger out of necessity, as there are very few burger places where I'm at (Abroad). Meat: 80/20 mince, divide and lightly form into patties, make it thinner than you think and pinch the center a little (it will puff up don't worry). Season generously with salt (preferably of the kosher or coarse variety), and rub it in. Pepper will burn. On the pan, put in some oil (can be as little or as much as a few millimeters). Put the heat on high and wait for the pan to get hot (Oil just about to smoke), then put the burgers on and don't touch them! wait a few moments then flip using a spatula. Wait until the juices run clear (or not), put the pepper and cheese on top now if you wish. Take it off and let it rest for a few minutes. Now the second ingredient which is often overlooked is bread. Put the broiler on. Butter generously, or you can mix olive oil and warm butter and drizzle (or drench!) on the bread. Stick it in the oven face up (broiler!) until it starts to get slightly golden/crispy. A good bun makes all the difference. An old stale bun can make even the best burger meat suck balls. For toppings I recommend thinly sliced dill pickles, sauteed/carmelized onions, tomatos, and maybe lettuce. I use mayo on bottom and BBQ sauce on top.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

I'm by no means a burger master, but I make a decent burger out of necessity, as there are very few burger places where I'm at (Abroad). Meat: 80/20 mince, divide and lightly form into patties, make it thinner than you think and pinch the center a little (it will puff up don't worry). Season generously with salt (preferably of the kosher or coarse variety), and rub it in. Pepper will burn. On the pan, put in some oil (can be as little or as much as a few millimeters). Put the heat on high and wait for the pan to get hot (Oil just about to smoke), then put the burgers on and don't touch them! wait a few moments then flip using a spatula. Wait until the juices run clear (or not), put the pepper and cheese on top now if you wish. Take it off and let it rest for a few minutes. Now the second ingredient which is often overlooked is bread. Put the broiler on. Butter generously, or you can mix olive oil and warm butter and drizzle (or drench!) on the bread. Stick it in the oven face up (broiler!) until it starts to get slightly golden/crispy. A good bun makes all the difference. An old stale bun can make even the best burger meat suck balls. For toppings I recommend thinly sliced dill pickles, sauteed/carmelized onions, tomatos, and maybe lettuce.

{"text":"Try to focus on recipes that have specific techniques that take time to learn. A big one would be cooking things the right amount that require more of a \"sense\" of when they are done. Like caramelized onions, poached eggs, grilled meats, fried chicken, or reductions. Another would be \"shaping\" such as tortellini, wontons, or gnocchi. Even things requiring unique knife skills, although that is mostly garnishes. Another big one is sauces and emulsions like hollandaise, mayo, and pan gravy. The final technique that takes time to learn and can be made more difficult with a recipe is timing. When you need to get multiple parts of a meal done at the same time and are jumping back and forth. If you don't plan everything well you can be in trouble quickly. So just come up with a meal that incorporates as many of those as possible.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

A big one would be cooking things the right amount that require more of a \"sense\" of when they are done. Like caramelized onions, poached eggs, grilled meats, fried chicken, or reductions. Another would be \"shaping\" such as tortellini, wontons, or gnocchi. Even things requiring unique knife skills, although that is mostly garnishes. Another big one is sauces and emulsions like hollandaise, mayo, and pan gravy. The final technique that takes time to learn and can be made more difficult with a recipe is timing. When you need to get multiple parts of a meal done at the same time and are jumping back and forth. If you don't plan everything well you can be in trouble quickly.

{"text":"Stock, stock, stock. I have a freezer full of 2 cup full containers label dated stocks. Pork, chicken, beef and veal. I am the queen of the fumet and always scrambling about trying to get whole fish. I can make any sauce at a moments notice, or a lovely risotto. I use leaves from any root veg, I am wild for greens, and sometimes I just blanch the greens and add a pinch of sugar and red wine vinegar and serve them with the veg. Roasted beets look stunning with their blanched chopped greens and can be pepped up with some crumbled bits of strong cheese, chevre or gorgonzola. We do a lot of juicing here, and that has cut down on our throwaways. You can drink the juice, or use it to fortify some braising liquid. You don't want to juice bones though... Carrot juice needs tasting for balance, but is great for tenderizing a cheap cut of beef. I even recycle bones after I make stock by giving them to the dogs.

{"text":"You have a stove top and love vegetables? How about making ciambotta? It's the easiest goddamned thing: the way my grandma taught me was to take a big ol' pot and fill it with garlic cloves and sliced onion, zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, bell peppers, tomatoes, maybe some string beans if you want, and celery (if you can get your hands on some leaves then all the better) and season it generously with basil, oregano, black pepper, and salt. Let it stew on the stove until all of the vegetables are softened and a broth has formed (the vegetables provide the liquid), then add potatoes. It's a pretty flexible recipe so feel free to add mushrooms into the pot, though I've never done that since mushrooms are the grossest goddamned food ew ew ew Also, if you want it to last longer you

{"text":"I can not fathom how this recipe has only 4 upvotes by now. This is exactly how french onion soup should be made! I have one small hint, though - if you add a pinch of baking soda to the onions while you heat them, you can lower the heat considerably and thus avoid burning them. The sodium bicarbonate raises the pH in the pan and quickens the chemical reaction that turns the onions brown (it's actually not caramelization, but a non-enzymatic reaction between the sugar and amino-acids called maillard reaction.

This is exactly how french onion soup should be made! I have one small hint, though - if you add a pinch of baking soda to the onions while you heat them, you can lower the heat considerably and thus avoid burning them. The sodium bicarbonate raises the pH in the pan and quickens the chemical reaction that turns the onions brown (it's actually not caramelization, but a non-enzymatic reaction between the sugar and amino-acids called maillard reaction. Sincerely, that guy.). The lower heat also helps to avoid the buildup of substances like acrylamide. edit: Kudos to you for the port, what a great idea!

{"text":"Just as an introduction to people who think they don't like tofu you should try Mapo Tofu...It's not exactly what you are asking for, but it fits in the same vein. It's one of my favorite dishes to make, and it's not only delicious but cheap and fast and a great gateway into what tofu can be. And yes there is meat... in it (there are also vegetarian/vegan adaptations but the dish isn't the same). But it's not really a meat dish, and it gives you that satisfying feeling you get from eating a bunch of meat, while only eating a little. I usually do 2 ounces of ground meat (pork is best, you want the fat) to 1 package of firm or extra firm silken tofu (silken is important!) . I've had the butcher ask why i want so little meat and even actually got him to try it himself. I eat way too much meat, most of us do. I wish I could eat less but it's satisfying, easy to cook, readily available (and never not ripe!), and really too cheap. (An aside, I sent my girlfriend to pick up some mushroom from safeway, and she got a package of 8 ounces, for 4 dollars, that's 8 dollars a pound for some fucking cremini mushrooms, there are so many meat options I can buy cheaper) But there are ways we can reduce our intake, and do better things for the planet, our taste buds, or even the animals (buying less of more expensive free range local meat from animals that had better lives than factory farmed meat). My real issue is just how hard it is to reduce my meat consumption at breakfast and lunch (I eat one or the other, along with dinner, so I usually am looking for something filling and satisfying). I can scramble up two eggs, throw a piece of ham with a slice of cheese in the toaster oven, throw two slices of bread in the toaster and have a really satisfying breakfast sandwich in around the same time it takes me to make a cup of coffee. I'm not into oatmeal or hot cereal (childhood trauma ;p), I do like granola, yogurt and fruit, but only if I can actually find ripe fruit. And it still isn't quite as satisfying. Anywhere I buy breakfast I can't remember the last time the vegetarian option appealed to me more than any of the normal ones. With lunch again, I can make a sandwich quickly, or buy one. I've tried some mozzerella tomato and basil sandwiches, but they are never good because the ingredients aren't fresh when you buy one, and you can't make one in the morning and not have it be soggy by lunchtime. When I go grab some tacos, kebab or a bahn mi again the veg options always seem more of an afterthought than anything. Or there just isn't the value on the menu, one deli where I used to live had a good eggplant sandwich, that cost just as much as a proscuitto brie and fig sandwich. Nothing against eggplant, but im taking the proscuitto brie and figs. As to straight up vegetarian, I'll do a coconut milk veggie curry with tofu (my curry paste probably has dried shrimp in it, but i know there are vegetarian alternatives). This chipotle miso tofu is also pretty damned good: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/07/grilled-tofu-chipotle-miso-recipe.html These Chayote squash tacos are so good you dont even think about meat when you eat them with some beans rice and grilled corn: https://www.rickbayless.com/roast-chayote-make-tacos-declare-victory/ Roasted butternut squash, carrot, onion, and mushroom enchiladas: Yea, that shit sounds great even if you were looking to eat meat. So many restaurants have blah vegetarian options, but this is something (similar) to what I ordered at a place because it sounded better than their meat dishes: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/12/enchiladas-suizas-rick-bayless-recipe.html I usually don't like vegetarian pastas, or well, I don't like vegetarian pastas with supermarket produce. It's never ripe enough, the flavors just don't pop. But if you've got a local market that has local food sources, or a farmers market there are a bunch of great pasta dishes you can make. The first is just a simple fresh tomato sauce with basil and olive oil. Best with fresh pasta, actually ripe tomatoes (two things money can't buy, love and actual vine ripened tomatoes) and good olive oil. :https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/anthony-bourdain/articles/spaghetti-with-fresh-tomato-sauce-and-basil but you can go all sorts of directions, get some fresh broad/fava beans, or some garden peas (also can throw either in a risotto).

It's one of my favorite dishes to make, and it's not only delicious but cheap and fast and a great gateway into what tofu can be. And yes there is meat... in it (there are also vegetarian/vegan adaptations but the dish isn't the same). But it's not really a meat dish, and it gives you that satisfying feeling you get from eating a bunch of meat, while only eating a little. I usually do 2 ounces of ground meat (pork is best, you want the fat) to 1 package of firm or extra firm silken tofu (silken is important!) . I've had the butcher ask why i want so little meat and even actually got him to try it himself. I eat way too much meat, most of us do. I wish I could eat less but it's satisfying, easy to cook, readily available (and never not ripe!), and really too cheap. (An aside, I sent my girlfriend to pick up some mushroom from safeway, and she got a package of 8 ounces, for 4 dollars, that's 8 dollars a pound for some fucking cremini mushrooms, there are so many meat options I can buy cheaper) But there are ways we can reduce our intake, and do better things for the planet, our taste buds, or even the animals (buying less of more expensive free range local meat from animals that had better lives than factory farmed meat). My real issue is just how hard it is to reduce my meat consumption at breakfast and lunch (I eat one or the other, along with dinner, so I usually am looking for something filling and satisfying). I can scramble up two eggs, throw a piece of ham with a slice of cheese in the toaster oven, throw two slices of bread in the toaster and have a really satisfying breakfast sandwich in around the same time it takes me to make a cup of coffee. I'm not into oatmeal or hot cereal (childhood trauma ;p), I do like granola, yogurt and fruit, but only if I can actually find ripe fruit. And it still isn't quite as satisfying. Anywhere I buy breakfast I can't remember the last time the vegetarian option appealed to me more than any of the normal ones. With lunch again, I can make a sandwich quickly, or buy one. I've tried some mozzerella tomato and basil sandwiches, but they are never good because the ingredients aren't fresh when you buy one, and you can't make one in the morning and not have it be soggy by lunchtime. When I go grab some tacos, kebab or a bahn mi again the veg options always seem more of an afterthought than anything. Or there just isn't the value on the menu, one deli where I used to live had a good eggplant sandwich, that cost just as much as a proscuitto brie and fig sandwich. Nothing against eggplant, but im taking the proscuitto brie and figs. As to straight up vegetarian, I'll do a coconut milk veggie curry with tofu (my curry paste probably has dried shrimp in it, but i know there are vegetarian alternatives). This chipotle miso tofu is also pretty damned good: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/07/grilled-tofu-chipotle-miso-recipe.html These Chayote squash tacos are so good you dont even think about meat when you eat them with some beans rice and grilled corn: https://www.rickbayless.com/roast-chayote-make-tacos-declare-victory/ Roasted butternut squash, carrot, onion, and mushroom enchiladas: Yea, that shit sounds great even if you were looking to eat meat. So many restaurants have blah vegetarian options, but this is something (similar) to what I ordered at a place because it sounded better than their meat dishes: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/12/enchiladas-suizas-rick-bayless-recipe.html I usually don't like vegetarian pastas, or well, I don't like vegetarian pastas with supermarket produce. It's never ripe enough, the flavors just don't pop. But if you've got a local market that has local food sources, or a farmers market there are a bunch of great pasta dishes you can make. The first is just a simple fresh tomato sauce with basil and olive oil. Best with fresh pasta, actually ripe tomatoes (two things money can't buy, love and actual vine ripened tomatoes) and good olive oil. :https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/anthony-bourdain/articles/spaghetti-with-fresh-tomato-sauce-and-basil but you can go all sorts of directions, get some fresh broad/fava beans, or some garden peas (also can throw either in a risotto). While we're talking italian pizza margherita is always great too.\n'''","response":"DISH: Mapo Tofu\nINGREDIENT: ground meat, pork, firm or extra firm silken tofu, mushroom, cremini mushrooms, eggs, ham, cheese, bread, granola, yogurt, fruit, mozzerella, tomato, basil, eggplant, coconut milk, veggie curry, tofu, chipotle miso tofu, Chayote squash, beans, rice, grilled corn, butternut squash, carrot, onion, mushroom, enchiladas, pasta, fresh tomato sauce, basil, olive oil, fresh broad/fava beans, garden peas, risotto, pizza margherita\nEQUIPMENT: None"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1698847475,"_annotator_id":"1058537d-c0ee-4cd4-ba4f-b10795efb717","_session_id":"ac45dc5c-bb7b-4df4-9361-433ba8750e2b"}

{"text":"That's a very easy fix - mix the oil/herbs/garlic, season it, basically everything except the vinegar. Then add the vinegar to taste. It's actually the way we do it at the restaurant I work at. We make a big batch of all the herbs, garlic and oil, season it, and then very finely dice some red onion and marinate it in red wine vinegar (to cover). When someone wants a side of chimichurri, we spoon some of the herb/oil mix into a bowl, and then add some of the onion/vinegar to taste.

{"text":"I do several things differently, make borscht for native Russians regularly to rave reviews, and I love it as well. My changes, off the top of my head, in no particular order: First, more beets, like 4-6 total. And I roast them in foil at 425 until they're tender while the meat is cooking. Not at all traditional, but it brings deeper flavor. Then peel and grate them in after the other vegetables have been added. Lemon juice from 1-2 lemons, to taste and depending on their size. Add some beef bones to the meat while it's boiling, then take them out. Makes the soup better. I use canned tomatoes. Just easier and tastier, unless they're in season. One 14-oz can with your choice of added seasonings, but I wouldn't use the Mexican flavor some stores have- wrong flavor profile. I add 1-3 tablespoons of \"better than boullion\" beef flavor. I know. I know. But it makes the soup taste like it's been cooking for days (in a good way). I try to make sure the ratio of liquid to meat and vegetables is such that it's more like a stew than a soup, but that's just because my eaters prefer borscht this way. Some fresh dill at the end of cooking- throw a few fronds in for about 5 minutes to simmer with the soup to add flavor, then pull them out so they don't get bitter. I do the same thing with the parsley. Add chopped to the bowls for serving.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

My changes, off the top of my head, in no particular order: First, more beets, like 4-6 total. And I roast them in foil at 425 until they're tender while the meat is cooking. Not at all traditional, but it brings deeper flavor. Then peel and grate them in after the other vegetables have been added. Lemon juice from 1-2 lemons, to taste and depending on their size. Add some beef bones to the meat while it's boiling, then take them out. Makes the soup better. I use canned tomatoes. Just easier and tastier, unless they're in season. One 14-oz can with your choice of added seasonings, but I wouldn't use the Mexican flavor some stores have- wrong flavor profile. I add 1-3 tablespoons of \"better than boullion\" beef flavor. I know. I know. But it makes the soup taste like it's been cooking for days (in a good way). I try to make sure the ratio of liquid to meat and vegetables is such that it's more like a stew than a soup, but that's just because my eaters prefer borscht this way. Some fresh dill at the end of cooking- throw a few fronds in for about 5 minutes to simmer with the soup to add flavor, then pull them out so they don't get bitter. I do the same thing with the parsley. Add chopped to the bowls for serving.\n'''","response":"DISH: borscht\nINGREDIENT: beets, lemon juice, beef bones, canned tomatoes, \"better than boullion\" beef flavor, fresh dill, parsley\nEQUIPMENT: None"},"_view_id":"ner_manual","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1698847078,"_annotator_id":"ee5f20ca-8238-4964-a3bd-ca1ed1b2eedc","_session_id":"d4aa69f4-7e31-429e-9c56-c04d3af71579"}
